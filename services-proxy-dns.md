To demonstrate the use of different types of Kubernetes services (LoadBalancer, ClusterIP, NodePort) with multiple pods, let's go through the steps of creating two pods, applying different services, and discussing their respective use cases and drawbacks.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create Namespace

Let's start by creating a namespace for our resources:

```sh
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
```

#### 2. Create Pod YAMLs

Create two Pod YAML files (`pod1.yaml` and `pod2.yaml`) for NGINX pods using `echo`:

```sh
# pod1.yaml
cat <<EOF > pod1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

```sh
# pod2.yaml
cat <<EOF > pod2.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

Apply the Pod configurations:

```sh
kubectl apply -f pod1.yaml
kubectl apply -f pod2.yaml
```

#### 3. Create Services YAMLs

##### a. ClusterIP Service

Create a ClusterIP service (`service-clusterip.yaml`) using `echo`:

```sh
cat <<EOF > service-clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service-clusterip
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
EOF
```

Apply the ClusterIP service:

```sh
kubectl apply -f service-clusterip.yaml
```

##### b. NodePort Service

Create a NodePort service (`service-nodeport.yaml`) using `echo`:

```sh
cat <<EOF > service-nodeport.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service-nodeport
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30080  # Specify a specific port or let Kubernetes allocate one
  type: NodePort
EOF
```

Apply the NodePort service:

```sh
kubectl apply -f service-nodeport.yaml
```

##### c. LoadBalancer Service

Create a LoadBalancer service (`service-loadbalancer.yaml`) using `echo`:

```sh
cat <<EOF > service-loadbalancer.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service-loadbalancer
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
EOF
```

Apply the LoadBalancer service:

```sh
kubectl apply -f service-loadbalancer.yaml
```

#### 4. Verify Services and Endpoints

Check services and endpoints:

```sh
kubectl get services -n my-namespace
kubectl get endpoints -n my-namespace
```

Note down the ClusterIP, NodePort, and external IP (for LoadBalancer service).

#### 5. Discuss Use Cases and Drawbacks

##### a. ClusterIP Service

- **Use Case:** Internal communication between microservices within the same namespace.
- **Drawbacks:** Not accessible outside the cluster without additional configurations (e.g., Ingress or LoadBalancer).

##### b. NodePort Service

- **Use Case:** Accessing applications from outside the Kubernetes cluster directly via a specific port on each node.
- **Drawbacks:** Limited by the port range (30000-32767) and potential security concerns if not properly configured.

##### c. LoadBalancer Service

- **Use Case:** Providing external access to applications via a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **Drawbacks:** Relies on cloud provider integration, may incur additional costs, and might be slower to provision compared to NodePort or ClusterIP.


### Testing Each Service with `curl`

#### 1. ClusterIP Service

To test the ClusterIP service:

1. Open a shell session inside a test pod within the same namespace:

```sh
kubectl run test-pod --rm -it --image=alpine --namespace=my-namespace -- sh
```

2. Install `curl` if it's not already installed:

```sh
apk add curl
```

3. Use `curl` to access the ClusterIP service:

```sh
curl http://my-service-clusterip.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

Replace `my-service-clusterip` with your actual service name and `my-namespace` with your namespace.

Example:
```sh
curl http://my-service-clusterip.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

You should receive the default NGINX welcome page or the expected response from your service.

#### 2. NodePort Service

To test the NodePort service:

1. Obtain the IP address of any Kubernetes node (`<node-ip>`).

2. Use `curl` to access the NodePort service using the NodePort (`<node-port>`) you specified:

```sh
curl http://<node-ip>:<node-port>
```

Replace `<node-ip>` and `<node-port>` with the actual IP address of a node in your cluster and the NodePort assigned to your service.

Example:
```sh
curl http://192.168.1.100:30080
```

You should receive the default NGINX welcome page or the expected response from your service.

#### 3. LoadBalancer Service

To test the LoadBalancer service:

1. Check the external IP assigned to the LoadBalancer service:

```sh
kubectl get services -n my-namespace
```

2. Use `curl` to access the service using the external IP:

```sh
curl http://<external-ip>
```

Replace `<external-ip>` with the external IP address assigned to your LoadBalancer service.

Example:
```sh
curl http://123.45.67.89
```

You should receive the default NGINX welcome page or the expected response from your service.

To validate the functionality of Kubernetes services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) using `iptables`, we'll inspect the `iptables` rules that Kubernetes sets up to understand how traffic is routed within the cluster.

### Validating Kubernetes Services with `iptables`

#### 1. ClusterIP Service

When you create a ClusterIP service, Kubernetes sets up `iptables` rules to route traffic to the service's ClusterIP. Here’s how you can validate it:

1. **List `iptables` rules related to ClusterIP service:**

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SERVICES -n
   ```

   This command lists the `iptables` rules in the `KUBE-SERVICES` chain, which includes rules for each ClusterIP service in your namespace. Look for rules that direct traffic to the ClusterIP of your service.

2. **Inspect specific `iptables` rules for the service:**

   Replace `my-service-clusterip` with your actual service name and `my-namespace` with your namespace:

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SVC-MY-SERVICE-CLUSTERIP -n
   ```

   This command lists the specific `iptables` rules in the `KUBE-SVC-MY-SERVICE-CLUSTERIP` chain, which routes traffic to the endpoints (pods) associated with your ClusterIP service.

#### 2. NodePort Service

For a NodePort service, `iptables` rules are set up to forward traffic from the specified NodePort on each node to the ClusterIP of the service. Here’s how to validate it:

1. **List `iptables` rules related to NodePort services:**

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -t nat -L KUBE-NODEPORTS -n
   ```

   This command lists the `iptables` rules in the `KUBE-NODEPORTS` chain, which include rules for each NodePort service in your namespace. Look for rules that map the NodePort to the ClusterIP.

2. **Inspect specific `iptables` rules for the NodePort service:**

   Replace `<node-port>` with the NodePort assigned to your service:

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SVC-MY-SERVICE-NODEPORT -n
   ```

   This command lists the specific `iptables` rules in the `KUBE-SVC-MY-SERVICE-NODEPORT` chain, which forwards traffic from the NodePort to the ClusterIP of your service.

#### 3. LoadBalancer Service

LoadBalancer services interact with `iptables` differently depending on the cloud provider. Typically, `iptables` rules may be set up to forward traffic from the external load balancer to the nodes hosting the service. Here’s how to validate it:

1. **List `iptables` rules related to LoadBalancer services:**

   LoadBalancer services often rely on cloud provider integration for `iptables` setup. You can inspect general `iptables` rules, but specifics may vary based on the provider.

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -t nat -L -n
   ```

   This command lists all `iptables` rules in the NAT table, including any rules related to external traffic forwarding.

2. **Inspect specific `iptables` rules for the LoadBalancer service:**

   Depending on your cloud provider, specific `iptables` rules might be implemented differently. Consult your cloud provider's documentation for detailed insights into how traffic is managed.

### Summary

Validating Kubernetes services using `iptables` helps ensure that traffic is correctly routed within your cluster. By inspecting these rules, you gain visibility into how Kubernetes manages networking for ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services.
