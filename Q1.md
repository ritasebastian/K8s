To create and verify two Nginx pods with labels `env=prod` and `env=dev`, follow these steps:

1. **Create the YAML file:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-prod
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-dev
  labels:
    env: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

2. **Save the YAML file as `nginx-pods.yaml`**.

3. **Apply the YAML file using `kubectl`:**

```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx-pods.yaml
```

4. **Verify the creation and labels of the pods:**

```sh
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

This command will list all the pods along with their labels. You should see something similar to:

```
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-prod   1/1     Running   0          1m    env=prod
nginx-dev    1/1     Running   0          1m    env=dev
```

5. **Verify specific pods based on labels:**

To verify the individual pods based on their labels, you can use label selectors:

```sh
kubectl get pods -l env=prod
kubectl get pods -l env=dev
```

This will show the pods filtered by the `env` label.

**Note:** Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, and you have the `kubectl` command-line tool configured to interact with your cluster.
