To add a taint to a node and then list nodes with a specific taint effect, follow these steps:

1. **Add a taint to the node "worker-2":**

```sh
kubectl taint nodes worker-2 key=value:NoSchedule
```

Replace `key` and `value` with appropriate values as per your requirements. For example:

```sh
kubectl taint nodes worker-2 environment=production:NoSchedule
```

2. **List nodes with the taint effect "NoSchedule":**

```sh
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.taints != null) | select(.spec.taints[] | select(.effect == "NoSchedule")) | .metadata.name'
```

Alternatively, you can use `kubectl describe` to manually check the taints:

```sh
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 2 Taints
```

This command will provide detailed information about the nodes, including their taints, allowing you to identify nodes with the `NoSchedule` effect.
